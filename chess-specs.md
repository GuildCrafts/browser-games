##Setup

- A jquery function creates the game board
- use :nth child to create the checker effect
- create pawns in the second row
- allow pawns to move two spaces in their first turn and one space after
- create the rooks (end pieces) and allow them to move horizontally
- create the knights and allow them to move in an l shaped pattern
- create the bishops that move diagonally
- create king and allow him to move one space in any direction
- create queen and allow her to move wherever she wants in her boundaries
- mirror the board on the other side in a different color and flip the king and queen
- check for wins by checking the location on the game board
- reset game triggers when a button is clicked and returns pieces to their original location
- handle moves by deleting divs and creating new ones
