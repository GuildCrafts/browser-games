## Installation and Setup

Clone the repo, install npm dependencies, and start the server:

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:GuildCrafts/browser-games.git
$ cd browser-games
$ npm install

...

$ npm start
...
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:4321
  http://10.0.1.11:4321
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321/` in your browser of choice and play away!

## Description

Build simple graphical games for the browser.

Fork the the browser-games repository and use the fork as your project artifact.

Implement the games Tic-Tac-Toe and Simon from the list in the games.md file. As a stretch, implement the Connect Four game.

You will be using FreeCodeCamp challenges as guides and tutorials for building these games.

## Context

This goal will challenge your ability to take a formal, defined system from the real world and replicate it in code. You will start with all of the logic of the system (the rules of the game) and most of the UI already designed.

Your work will be mainly in deciding how to replicate that formal logic and user interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
