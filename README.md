Context

This goal will challenge your ability to take a formal, defined system from the real world and replicate it in code. You will start with all of the logic of the system (the rules of the game) and most of the UI already designed.

Your work will be mainly in deciding how to replicate that formal logic and user interface using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
